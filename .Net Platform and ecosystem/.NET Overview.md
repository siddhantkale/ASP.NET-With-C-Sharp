# üåê .NET Platform Overview

# üìå What is .NET?

**.NET** is a developer platform by **Microsoft** that allows you to build a wide range of applications ‚Äî including **web**, **desktop**, **mobile**, **cloud**, **IoT**, and more ‚Äî using multiple languages such as **C#**, **F#**, and **VB.NET**.

It provides:
- A **runtime** environment for your applications
- A rich set of **libraries** and **tools** to speed up development
- A **compiler** and **build system**
- A **unified development platform** for cross-platform apps

| Application Type | Technology Used                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Web Apps         | ASP.NET Core (MVC, Razor, Blazor)    |
| APIs             | ASP.NET Core Web API                 |
| Desktop Apps     | Windows Forms, WPF, MAUI             |
| Mobile Apps      | .NET MAUI, Xamarin                   |
| Games            | Unity (uses C# for scripting)        |
| IoT              | .NET IoT Libraries                   |
| Cloud Apps       | .NET + Azure                         |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Concepts of the .NET Platform

### üì¶ .NET SDK
The **Software Development Kit** that includes:
- **Compilers** (e.g. `csc` for C#)
- **CLI tools** like `dotnet`
- Project **templates**
- Base libraries

### ‚öôÔ∏è .NET Runtime
The environment where your app runs ‚Äî similar to Java's JVM.

- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**  
  Manages memory, handles exceptions, and executes code.

- **JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)**  
  Converts Intermediate Language (IL) into native machine code at runtime.

### üìö BCL (Base Class Library)
A large collection of built-in libraries for common tasks like:
- File I/O
- Networking
- Collections
- Data types
- LINQ
- JSON/XML processing

### üß¨ IL (Intermediate Language)
Your C# code is first compiled into IL (platform-independent bytecode).  
Then, the CLR converts IL into native machine code via JIT compilation.

### üì¶ NuGet
The **package manager** for .NET ‚Äî similar to `npm` for Node.js.  
Used to install and manage third-party libraries and tools.

## üß† What Is Legacy?

**Legacy** = Old but still used.  
Legacy tech is outdated, less efficient, and no longer gets major updates.  
.NET Framework is considered legacy ‚Äî it works, but it‚Äôs no longer the future.

## üß© What Is Modularity?

- **Monolithic** = Everything bundled together. Can't pick and choose.
- **Modular** = App uses only required packages (via **NuGet**).
- Smaller apps, faster builds, easier updates.

üìù In .NET Core and .NET 5+, you only install the packages you need.

---

## üöÄ Deployment: Self-contained vs Framework-dependent

| Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Framework-Dependent** | App needs .NET runtime installed on the system (smaller app size).         |
| **Self-Contained**      | App includes .NET runtime inside it ‚Äî runs anywhere (larger app size).     |

üìå Use self-contained when you don‚Äôt control the environment (e.g., client machines, Docker, cloud).

---

## üì¶ What Are Containers?

- **Containers** = Lightweight, isolated environments for running apps (like mini VMs).
- Package your app + runtime + settings using tools like **Docker**.
- Ensures your app runs the same **everywhere** (dev, test, prod).

# üîç Common Language Runtime (CLR)

The **Common Language Runtime (CLR)** is the core execution engine of the .NET platform. It runs .NET applications by converting compiled code into native machine code and managing various low-level operations for you.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è What CLR Does

- Runs .NET apps by converting IL to native code using **JIT (Just-In-Time) Compilation**
- Manages memory via **Garbage Collection (GC)**
- Handles **exceptions** and structured error handling
- Ensures **type safety** and **security**
- Manages **threads** and parallel execution
- Loads and verifies **assemblies** (.dll/.exe)

---

## üîÑ How .NET Code Runs

1. You write C# (or any .NET language)
2. Compiler converts it to **Intermediate Language (IL)**
3. CLR loads the IL and JIT-compiles it into **native machine code**
4. Native code is executed by the OS

```plaintext
C# Code ‚Üí Intermediate Language (IL) ‚Üí JIT ‚Üí Native Machine Code ‚Üí Execution
```

### üß± CLR Core Components

| Component           | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JIT Compiler**     | Converts IL (Intermediate Language) to native machine code at runtime     |
| **Garbage Collector**| Automatically manages memory by removing unused objects                  |
| **Class Loader**     | Loads classes and metadata from assemblies (.dll/.exe)                    |
| **Security Engine**  | Enforces runtime security policies and permissions                       |
| **Thread Manager**   | Manages threads and supports parallel/multitasking execution             |
| **Exception Manager**| Handles exceptions and structured error processing                       |
| **Interop Services** | Enables interaction with unmanaged/native code (e.g., C/C++ libraries)   |

---

### üìò Intermediate Language (IL)

| Feature             | Description                                                               |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **What is IL?**      | CPU-independent bytecode generated by .NET compilers                     |
| **Purpose**          | Acts as an intermediate format before being converted to machine code    |
| **Execution**        | The CLR uses the JIT compiler to convert IL to native machine code at runtime |
| **Language Support** | All .NET languages (C#, F#, VB.NET) compile down to IL                   |
| **Inspection Tools** | Tools like ILDASM, ILSpy, and dotPeek allow viewing and analyzing IL code|
| **Storage Format**   | Stored inside `.dll` or `.exe` files as MSIL (Microsoft IL) or CIL (Common IL) |


# üß© Managed vs Unmanaged Code

**Managed Code**  
Code that runs under the control of the **.NET CLR (Common Language Runtime)**.  
It benefits from automatic memory management, type safety, and built-in exception handling.

- Written in: C#, F#, VB.NET  
- Managed by: CLR  
- Memory: Garbage Collected  
- Safer and easier to maintain

**Unmanaged Code**  
Code that runs **directly on the operating system** without CLR support.  
The developer is responsible for memory management, error handling, and security.

- Written in: C, C++, Assembly  
- Managed by: Developer  
- Memory: Manual (e.g., malloc/free)  
- Offers more control but with higher risk

| Feature             | Managed Code           | Unmanaged Code        |
|---------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Runtime             | CLR                    | OS directly            |
| Memory Management   | Automatic (GC)         | Manual                 |
| Type Safety         | Enforced               | Not guaranteed         |
| Control             | Less (safer)           | More (riskier)         |
| Common Languages    | C#, F#, VB.NET         | C, C++, Assembly       |

# NuGet Package Manager

**NuGet** is the official package manager for .NET, used to add, manage, and restore third-party libraries and dependencies in your projects. It helps you reuse code easily by distributing libraries as packages.

---

## How NuGet Works in a Project

NuGet package dependencies are listed in the project file (`.csproj`) inside an `<ItemGroup>` as `<PackageReference>` elements.

```xml
<ItemGroup>
  <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
  <PackageReference Include="Serilog" Version="2.10.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

# NuGet Package Manager Commands

| Command                                | Description                             |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `dotnet add package <package_name>`   | Adds a NuGet package to your project  |
| `dotnet restore`                      | Restores all NuGet packages for a project |
| `dotnet remove package <package_name>`| Removes a NuGet package from your project |


# .NET CLI Basics

The **.NET CLI (Command Line Interface)** is a cross-platform tool to create, build, run, and manage .NET projects from the terminal. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

---

## Common .NET CLI Commands
