# 🌐 .NET Platform Overview

## 📌 What is .NET?

**.NET** is a developer platform by **Microsoft** that allows you to build a wide range of applications — including **web**, **desktop**, **mobile**, **cloud**, **IoT**, and more — using multiple languages such as **C#**, **F#**, and **VB.NET**.

It provides:
- A **runtime** environment for your applications
- A rich set of **libraries** and **tools** to speed up development
- A **compiler** and **build system**
- A **unified development platform** for cross-platform apps

## 🚀 What Can You Build with .NET?

| Application Type | Technology Used                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Web Apps         | ASP.NET Core (MVC, Razor, Blazor)    |
| APIs             | ASP.NET Core Web API                 |
| Desktop Apps     | Windows Forms, WPF, MAUI             |
| Mobile Apps      | .NET MAUI, Xamarin                   |
| Games            | Unity (uses C# for scripting)        |
| IoT              | .NET IoT Libraries                   |
| Cloud Apps       | .NET + Azure                         |

## ⚙️ Core Concepts of the .NET Platform

### 📦 .NET SDK
The **Software Development Kit** that includes:
- **Compilers** (e.g. `csc` for C#)
- **CLI tools** like `dotnet`
- Project **templates**
- Base libraries

### ⚙️ .NET Runtime
The environment where your app runs — similar to Java's JVM.

- **CLR (Common Language Runtime)**  
  Manages memory, handles exceptions, and executes code.

- **JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)**  
  Converts Intermediate Language (IL) into native machine code at runtime.

### 📚 BCL (Base Class Library)
A large collection of built-in libraries for common tasks like:
- File I/O
- Networking
- Collections
- Data types
- LINQ
- JSON/XML processing

### 🧬 IL (Intermediate Language)
Your C# code is first compiled into IL (platform-independent bytecode).  
Then, the CLR converts IL into native machine code via JIT compilation.

### 📦 NuGet
The **package manager** for .NET — similar to `npm` for Node.js.  
Used to install and manage third-party libraries and tools.
