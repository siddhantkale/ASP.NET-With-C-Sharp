# 🗂️ .NET Project Structure Overview

A typical .NET project consists of several standard files and folders. Here's a breakdown of the most important parts of the structure.

---

## 📄 `.csproj` – Project File

Defines the project configuration.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net8.0</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Newtonsoft.Json" Version="13.0.1" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```
### 🧾 `.csproj` – Project File

Specifies:

- **SDK type**
- **Target framework**
- **Package dependencies**
- **Build and output configuration**

---

### 📌 `Program.cs`

- Entry point for the application
- Contains `Main()` method (for Console Apps)
- In ASP.NET Core (minimal hosting), configures the app directly

---

### ⚙️ `Startup.cs` (Older ASP.NET Core Versions)

Used to configure:

- `ConfigureServices()` → Register services and dependencies
- `Configure()` → Set up HTTP request pipeline

📌 In .NET 6+, this is typically replaced by minimal hosting via `Program.cs`.

---

### 🧭 `Properties/launchSettings.json`

Used for local development configuration. Defines:

- **Launch profiles** (e.g., Kestrel, IIS)
- **Environment variables**
- **Hosting URLs**

---

### 📦 `bin/` and `obj/` Folders

| Folder | Description                           |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| `bin/` | Compiled assemblies (.dll/.exe)       |
| `obj/` | Temporary files used during build     |

> These folders are auto-generated and can be cleaned.

---

### 🧩 MVC Structure (ASP.NET Core MVC)

- `Controllers/` → Handle HTTP requests (e.g., `HomeController.cs`)
- `Views/` → Razor UI templates (`.cshtml` files)
- `Models/` → Define data structures and business logic

---

### 🌐 `wwwroot/` (ASP.NET Core Web Apps)

- Holds public **static assets** (CSS, JS, images)
- Files in this folder are served directly to the browser
- Equivalent to the `public/` folder in many web frameworks
